Q1. What happens when we run program without 'static' keyword?
Ans->Error: Main method is not static in class Helloji, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)

It gives error on run time, it is because JVM does not have any object to run the main method it directly so it runs the program using class name.
------------------------------
Q2. What happens when the filename is different than the class name in the file?
Ans->It depends whether class is public or not,

If the class public then the file name and class name shoud be matched.

If the class is not public then no need to match file name and class name.
-----------------------------
Q3. Write Java programs to find out what happen when we use different type of literals for data types.
Like try to use float literal for integer data type
Ans->
error: incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from float to int
int x=2.4f;	
if we are trying to store float literal to int type it gives error.
-----------------------------
Q4. Why java is Simple?
Ans->Java is simple because java does not support complex like pointer so that the execution time for execution of program will be less.
It has concept of garbage collection which automatically destroy the useless objects.
-----------------------------

Q5. Why java is secured language?
Ans->The main reason,java is more secured because java does not support the concept of pointers,because if java support pointers then user can easily point to any memory location.
-----------------------------

Q6. Why java is portable?
Ans-> Java is portable beacause you can run any java .class file created in one operating system to another operating sysytem.
-----------------------------

Q7. Why java is robust?
Ans-> Java is robust is because it has strong memory management.It has security features, in absence of pointers it bypass the security dilemmas.
-----------------------------

Q8. How java is Architecture-Neutral?
Ans-> Java is Architectural neutral because there is no implementation dependent features, for example,  the size of primitive is fixed.
-----------------------------

Q9. Java has high Performance?
Ans->Java is faster than other traditional language python because it has compiler also, but it is slower than other compiler based language like C++.
-----------------------------

Q10.Why java is distributed? 
Ans->java is distributed because it provides users to create distributed applications in java.
     RMI(Remote Method Invocation) and EJB(Enterprise Java Beans) are used for creating distributed applications.
     This feature of java makes us able to access files by calling the methods from any machine on the internet.
-----------------------------

Q11.Why java is dynamic?
Ans-> Java is dynamic language because it supports dynamic loading of classes.It means classes are loaded on demand.
